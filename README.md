# Glacial Lake Depth Classification

## About 
Lake is any large body of slowly moving or standing water that occupies an inland basin of appreciable size. Glacial lake are formed at relatively higher altitudes when glacier melts down and gets trapped in between boundaries created by dirst, rock and debris called moraines. Glacial lake is a topic of extensive research and significance as bursting of these lakes causes floods in the downplain causing havoc. Lakes containing large volumes of water are more susceptible to outburst phenomenon and hence classifying these lakes into shallow and deeper ones and maybe used as early warnining.
